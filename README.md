# APET
APET (Automated Process of Enumeration in Terminator) is a script used to organize and automate the pentest process

<br>

### Installation process
Install required programs:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git terminator seclists ldap-utils 
python3 -m pip install impacket
```
Download the script from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChronosPK/APET.git
cd APET
./apet.sh -h
```

<br>

### Modify the commands
I added some of basic commands I already use when I encounter common services. <br>
You can see all of them if you provide the **`-c`** flag to the script. <br>
If you want to add your own versions, you are my guest! You have the source code!
